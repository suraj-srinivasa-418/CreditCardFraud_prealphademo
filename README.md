This repository contains one demo written within the Jupyter Notebook IDE within its earliest stages of development. This demo delves into a popular open ML dataset of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023. This dataset contains over 550,000 individual purchases and is a valuable resource for machine learning; particularly for developing detection models.
